# Ideas

- Average pixel color at each position among all abilities for given job
  - Overlay job icon over it?
- Get average pixel color for each ability, create a spectrum out of it
  - Maybe use this spectrum to create some sort of art with the job name or something (e.g. font color)
- Traits?
- How to deal with role actions (e.g. Tank actions for GLA?)
