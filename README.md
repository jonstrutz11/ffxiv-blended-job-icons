# ffxiv-blended-job-icons
All action icons for each class/job are blended together to create new backgrounds for each job/class icon!

![blended job icons infographic](blended_icons_infographic.png)

I used python to connect to [xivapi](https://xivapi.com/) to download all class and job icons as well as all the action icons for each job or class. From there, I used the python [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to blend each job's respective actions together.

These blended backgrounds are in `icons_blended_hd/actions_only` (low res versions exist in `icons_blended/actions_only`).

I also overlayed each class or job's icon ontop of the blended background. These can be found at `icons_blended_hd/actions_only_w_overlay`.

You can also just download all of these images by downloading the zip file, `icons_blended.zip` (low resolution) or `icons_blended_hd` (high resolution).
